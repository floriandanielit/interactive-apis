Regular strength\u2013balance exercises are highly recommended to reduce this problem and to improve health, well-being, and independence in old age. However, many older people face a lack of motivation in addition to other strong barriers to exercise. We developed ActiveLifestyle, an information technology (IT)-based system for active and healthy aging aiming at improving balance and strength. ActiveLifestyle is a training app that runs on a tablet and assists, monitors, and motivates older people to follow personalized training plans autonomously at home.<\/br>\r\nObjectives: The objectives were to (1) investigate which IT-mediated motivation strategies increase adherence to physical exercise training plans in older people, (2) assess the impact of ActiveLifestyle on physical activity behavior change, and (3) demonstrate the effectiveness of the ActiveLifestyle training to improve gait speed.<\/br>\r\nMethods: 44 older adults followed personalized, 12-week strength and balance training plans. All participants performed the exercises autonomously at home. Questionnaires were used to assess the technological familiarity and stage of behavior change, as well as the effectiveness of the motivation instruments adopted by ActiveLifestyle. Adherence to the exercise plan was evaluated using performance data collected by the app and through information given by the participants during the study. Pretests and posttests were performed to evaluate gait speed of the participants before and after the study.<\/br>\r\nResults: Participants were 75 years (SD 6); predominantly females (64%), hold trades or professional diploma (54%), and their past profession was in a sitting position (43%). Of the 44 participants who enrolled, 33 (75%) completed the study. The app proved to assist and motivate independently living and healthy older adults to autonomously perform strength\u2013balance exercises (median=6 on a 7-point Likert scale). Social motivation strategies proved more effective than individual strategies to stimulate the participants to comply with the training plan, as well as to change their behavior permanently toward a more physically active lifestyle. The exercises were effective to improve preferred and fast gait speed.<\/br>\r\nConclusions: ActiveLifestyle assisted and motivated independently living and healthy older people to autonomously perform strength\u2013balance exercises over 12 weeks and had low dropout rates. The social motivation strategies were more effective to stimulate the participants to comply with the training plan and remain on the intervention. The adoption of assistive technology devices for physical intervention tends to motivate and retain older people exercising for longer periods of time.","to_uploadresource":"117","where":"Journal of Medical Internet Research, Volume 15, Number 8, 2013.

Simple Flow targets end-users and programmers with no experience in programming for social networks, giving them the possibility to design processes by concatenating social network actions (like post a message or comment a photo). For the execution of the designed processes Simple Flow interconnects, at runtime, template web pages (one page per action) according to the process design defined previously.

The service-oriented architecture (SOA) has evolved traditional, manual business practices into modern, service-based IT practices that ease part of the problem: the systematic definition and execution of business processes. This, in turn, facilitates the online monitoring of system behaviors and the enforcement of allowed behaviors - all ingredients that can be used to assist compliance management on the fly during process execution. In this paper, instead of focusing on monitoring and runtime enforcement of rules or constraints, we strive for an alternative approach to com- pliance management in SOAs that aims at assessing and improving compliance. We propose two ingredients: (i) a model and tool to design compliant service-based processes and to instrument them in order to generate evidence of how they are executed and (ii) a reporting and analysis suite to create awareness of a company\u2019s compliance state and to enable understanding why and where compliance violations have occurred. Together, these ingredients result in an approach that is close to how the real stakeholders - compliance experts and auditors - actually assess the state of compliance in practice and that is less intrusive than enforcing compliance.","to_uploadresource":"110","where":"Service-Oriented Computing and Applications (SOCA), 2013, Springer.

In different contexts, ranging from the consumer Web to Enterprise systems, the potential of this new technology is to make users evolve from passive receivers of applications to actors actively involved in the creation of their artifacts, thus accommodating the inherent variability of the users' needs. Current advances in mashup technologies are good candidates to satisfy this requirement. However, some issues are still largely unexplored. In particular, quality issues specific for this class of applications, and the way they can guide the users in the identification of adequate components and composition patterns, are neglected. This paper discusses quality dimensions that can capture the intrinsic quality of mashup components, as well as the components' capacity to maximize the quality and the user-perceived value of the overall composition. It also proposes an assisted composition process in which quality becomes the driver for recommending to the users how to complete mashups, based on the integration of quality assessment and recommendation techniques within a tool for mashup development.","href":"publicationdetails.php?publication_oid=109","where":"QUATIC 2012, September 2012, Pages 10 - 19."},{"oid":"110","author":"P.Kucherbaev, S.

We harvest composition knowledge from a repository of existing mashup models by mining a set of reusable composition patterns, which we then use to interactively provide composition recommendations to developers while they model their own mashup. Upon acceptance of a recommendation, the purposeful design of the respective pattern types allows us to automatically weave the chosen pattern into a partial mashup model, in practice performing a set of modeling actions on behalf of the developer.

The reason for this success is ResEval Mash's domain specificity.","href":"publicationdetails.php?publication_oid=96","where":"WWW 2012 Companion, April 2012, Pages 361-364.

Pipes that guides and speeds up development by interactively recommending composition knowledge harvested from a repository of existing pipes. Composition knowledge is delivered in the form of reusable mashup patterns, which are retrieved and ranked on the fly while the developer models his own pipe (the mashup) and that are automatically weaved into his pipe model upon selection. Baya mines candidate patterns from pipe models available online and thereby leverages on the knowledge of the crowd, i.e., of other developers. Baya is an extension for the Firefox browser that seamlessly integrates with Pipes. It enhances Pipes with a powerful new feature for both expert developers and beginners, speeding up the former and enabling the latter. The discovery of composition knowledge is provided as a service and can easily be extended toward other modeling environments.","href":"publicationdetails.php?publication_oid=95","where":"WWW 2012 Companion, April 2012, Pages 409-412.

Targeting the Web community and, in particular, Web application developers, service providers expose capabilities of their infrastructures and applications in order to open new markets and to reach new customer groups. However, due to the complexity of the underlying technologies, the last step, i.e., the consumption and integration of the offered services, is a non-trivial and time-consuming task that is still a prerogative of expert developers. Although many approaches to lower the entry barriers for end users exist, little success has been achieved so far. In this paper, we introduce the OMELETTE project and show how it addresses end-user-oriented telco mashup development. We present the goals of the project, describe its contributions, summarize current results, and describe current and future work.","href":"publicationdetails.php?publication_oid=100","where":"WWW 2012 Companion, April 2012, Pages 235-238."},{"oid":"103","author":"J.-N.

First, there is a lack of integration of WSNs with business process back-ends. Second, programming WSNs is still challenging as it is mainly performed at the operating system level. To this end, we provide makeSense - a unified programming framework and a compilation chain that, from high-level business process specifications, generates code ready for deployment on WSN nodes.","href":"publicationdetails.php?publication_oid=93","where":"EWSN 2012, February 2012.
