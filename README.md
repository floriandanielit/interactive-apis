Interactive API (iAPI) Engine
================

The goal of this project is to jointly develop an **in-browser engine for** [iAPIs]
(http://www.w3.org/community/interative-apis/). The engine comes in the form 
of a **Google Chrome extension** able to parse iAPI annotations, to render graphical 
controls for them, to interpret user interactions as programming instructions, 
and to run iAPI-based applications or processes.

of the [BSD license](https://github.com/floriandanielit/interactive-apis/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).


iAPI reference specification
----------
The purpose of this project is the implementation of an engine for iAPIs that is 
compliant with the specification of the [iAPI HTML annotation format]
(http://www.w3.org/community/interative-apis/wiki/Main_Page). The specification is developed and 
maintained by the [W3C Interactive APIs Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/interative-apis/).
The Group is open, participation is free, and contributions are welcome from everyone.


Features and requirements
---------

### Features

* Identifies iAPIs in web pages and injects suitable interactive, graphical controls
* Fetches data from iAPIs in remote web pages and renders them inside a local page
* Drag and drop reuse of data between iAPIs in different pages
* Engine can easily be switched on/off

### Requirements

* Google Chrome web browser (tested with version 31 for Mac or version XX for Win)
