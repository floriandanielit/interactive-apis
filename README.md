iAPI Engine
================

The goal of this project is to develop an **in-browser engine for interactive APIs** ([iAPIs]
(http://www.w3.org/community/interative-apis/)). The engine comes in the form 
of a **Google Chrome extension** able to parse iAPI annotations, to render graphical 
controls for them, to interpret user interactions as programming instructions, 
and to run iAPI-based applications or processes.
