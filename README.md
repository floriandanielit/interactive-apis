Interactive API (iAPI) middleware for UI-oriented computing

This project develops a middleware for the integration of iAPIs as discussed in the 
W3C Interactive APIs Community Group (http://www.w3.org/community/interative-apis/).
In its first version, the middleware comes as an extension of Google Chrome. Other
implementations may follow.
